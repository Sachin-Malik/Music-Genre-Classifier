1. Run the attached code in Google Collab (cloud Platform ) for best experience.
2. The Dataset used is GTZAN (1.23GB)
3. If you don't want to upload whole dataset onto drive , we have also provided a "FEATURES.CSV" file also.
4. To Run Project in this way just upload this .csv file to drive and start executing code from cell no.4.
5. Rest of the code should run file if all the library are properly loaded.
   Thank You.
